### Using Machine Learning techniques to classify images of American Sign Language (ASL).

The significant research that has been performed for ASL recognition demonstrates its importance and how better models can better benefit the deaf or mute community, giving them the voice to universally communicate with others. For our project specifically, we attempt to classify ASL alphabet letters, A-Z, as well as the symbols that represent SPACE, DELETE and NOTHING. We hope this project will help those unfamiliar with ASL and to help bridge the language barrier.
