# DetectiveASL
#### A collaborative project by: Yi Jiang, Sophia Wong

## Problem Description
Our machine learning problem is classifying images of American Sign Language (ASL) hand gestures. We attempt to classify ASL alphabet letters, A-Z, as well as the symbols that represent SPACE, DELETE and NOTHING. We hope this project will help those unfamiliar with ASL and to help bridge the language barrier.
